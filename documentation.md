# Weather Agent Documentation

## Tool/Function Usage Documentation

### API Integration
The Weather Agent utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API as its primary tool for fetching real-time weather data. This API was chosen for several reasons:
- Reliable and well-documented service
- Comprehensive weather data
- Free tier available for development
- Real-time weather updates
- Global coverage

### Agent Implementation

The agent is implemented in the `WeatherAgent` class with the following key components:

1. **Initialization**
   - Loads API key from environment variables
   - Sets up base URL for API requests
   - Configures error handling

2. **Core Functions**
   - `get_weather(city)`: Makes API calls to fetch weather data
   - `format_weather_info(weather_info)`: Formats the data for display

3. **API Integration Flow**
   1. User inputs a city name
   2. Agent constructs API request with parameters
   3. API call is made using the requests library
   4. Response is processed and relevant data extracted
   5. Formatted weather information is displayed

### Error Handling
The agent implements robust error handling for:
- Missing API keys
- Network errors
- Invalid city names
- API response errors

### Security Considerations
- API key is stored in environment variables
- Sensitive data is not exposed in the code
- HTTPS is used for API calls
